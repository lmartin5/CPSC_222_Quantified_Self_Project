    "## Data Preperation\n",
    "The Fitbit website allows access to personal data in a very friendly format. I have access to both my sleep and activity data gathered by my device from September 17, 2020 to the present. Looking at the data using Microsoft Excel, I can see that every entry is a numerical value, except for the date and time stamps. A few of the columns will also have to be converted from strings to integers due to the prescence of commas. The activity CSV has one date column for which every other attribute has a corresponding value. The sleep CSV meanwhile, has two timestamps columns: one for the sleep start time and one for the sleep stop time. That will be my main task in preparing the data. \n",

    "`Pandas` will be the main module used for working directly with the data, and the `read_csv()` function can be used to load the data directly. The `index_col` key word in the `read_csv()` function can be set to 0 when loading in the activity data because it already has the date in a usable format. More work will have to be done using the time stamps in the sleep data to get a identical index column. The `set_option()` function is used to force the program to display all of the columns of the DataFrame as discussed [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.set_option.html)."

    "I want the instances of the activity DataFrame and the instances of the sleep DataFrame to line up so that I can compare them. For this project, I want to compare my sleep data for each day to my activity data for the day preceding the sleep. First, I need to get just the desired date from the time stamps, and then get rid of the two time stamp columns. Because I sometimes went to sleep before midnight and sometimes after midnight, I need to only use the \"End Time\" column. The dash characters need to be [replaced](https://pythonbasics.org/replace/) with forward slash charcters just like in the activity DataFrame. After that, I have to [sort](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_index.html) the order of the sleep DataFrame so that it is in ascending chronological order similar to the activity DataFrame. I am going to have to also shift the dates over one day, so that the first data point in the activity data lines up with the first data point in the sleep data; the first index for each should be September 17, 2020."
