    "## Data Preperation\n",
    "The Fitbit website allows access to personal data in a very friendly format. I have access to both my sleep and activity data gathered by my device from September 17, 2020 to the present. Looking at the data using Microsoft Excel, I can see that every entry is a numerical value, except for the date and time stamps. The activity CSV has one date column for which every other attribute has a corresponding value. The sleep CSV meanwhile, has two timestamps columns: one for the sleep start time and one for the sleep stop time. That will be my main task in preparing the data. \n",

    "Just looking at both CSV files in Microsoft Excel, I can see that both top rows contain one cell that has the label for the data table.  \n",

    "Since this is a one-step process, for both CSV files I just manually deleted the top row, so that now the top row only contains the column labels.  \n",
