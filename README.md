# Sleep and Exercise Project
This repository contains the Quantified Self project completed for the CPSC 222 course at Gonzaga University taught by Dr. Gina Sprint. It utilizes common data science and machine learning libraries such as sklearn, matplotlib, and Pandas. 

## Files
This repository contains a Technical Report as a Jupyter Notebook, utilities files as python source code, CSV data files, and PNGs that are rendered in the notebook.

## Running Project
If all files from this repository are in one folder, the Jupyter Notebook can be ran in any software that allows it, such as VS Code or Jupyter Lab. This project was created using the Anaconda distribution of the Python coding language. If the libraries used in this project, such as Pandas and Numpy, are not downloaded, the project will not run correctly.
